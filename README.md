# Text Generation Tool

This is a C++ program that reads in a sample text file and uses it to generate new text that mimics the writing style of the sample. The program includes several functions for manipulating data stored in vectors and maps, and a custom random number generator class. It allows the user to input certain commands in the command line to perform various actions, such as printing the elements of a vector or map, loading data from a file into a vector or map, and generating and printing a specified number of words of text based on the data in a map.


To use the program, simply compile and run it in your C++ environment, and follow the prompts in the command line. You can also customize the program by modifying the functions or adding new ones as needed.


This program is a useful tool for anyone interested in generating text based on a sample, and can be used for various purposes such as language modeling or text generation for creative writing.
